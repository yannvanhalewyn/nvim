# Neovim Simple Config

A lean and fast Neovim configuration designed for Clojure development. Inspired by [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) but built from scratch while still incorporating the nice UI NvChad offers.

## Features

- **Modern Neovim**: Uses native LSP and vim.pack package management (requires Neovim 0.12+)
- **NvChad UI**: Retains the beautiful statusline and base46 colorschemes from the amazing NvChad distro
- **Clojure-focused**: Optimized specifically for Clojure development workflow
- **Minimal & Fast**: Clean, simple configuration without unnecessary bells and whistles. Most configuration fits in a single ~300 line `init.lua` file

## Why This Config?

While [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) is an excellent Neovim distribution with fantastic UI components, this config strips away the complexity to focus on what matters most for Clojure development - speed, clarity, and simplicity.
